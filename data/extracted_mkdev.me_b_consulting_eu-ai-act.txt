EU AI Act compliance consulting The EU AI Act is here, and it’s reshaping how companies build and deploy AI across Europe It’s coming. If your product uses AI in any form, whether it’s LLM calls, third-party APIs, or internally trained models, you likely need to comply. The problem?

This is where we come in. We offer straightforward AI Act compliance consulting designed specifically for engineering and product teams. We’ll help you understand what obligations apply to your AI systems, how to get compliant, and how to do it without slowing your roadmap. No vague templates. No “just hire legal.” Just real, practical advice — delivered in your language, not legalese.
