Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science focused on building systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. 
AI research in Vienna is supported by universities like TU Wien and research institutes focusing on robotics, natural language processing, and ethics of AI.
Berlin has a strong AI ecosystem with organizations like the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) and several AI startups. The city also hosts conferences on applied machine learning.
Both Vienna and Berlin contribute to Europe's AI research landscape, but with different strengths: Vienna in ethics and academic research, Berlin in startups and applied AI.
